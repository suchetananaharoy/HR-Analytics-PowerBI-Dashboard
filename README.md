This project presents an HR Analytical Dashboard developed using Microsoft Power BI to provide data-driven insights into workforce metrics. The dashboard integrates cleaned and transformed HR datasets using Power Query and DAX for calculated measures, KPIs, and dynamic filters. It visualizes employee demographics, attrition rates, performance indicators, department-wise distribution, and hiring trends through interactive charts, slicers, and drill-through reports. Data modeling techniques such as star schema design and relationship management were applied to optimize performance. The dashboard supports strategic HR decision-making by enabling real-time exploration of workforce patterns, identifying key risk areas, and improving talent management processes. This project demonstrates skills in data modeling, DAX functions, visualization design, and business intelligence reporting.
